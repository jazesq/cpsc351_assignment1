We used C++.
To execute our program:
 -Open the terminal and ensure that the current directory contains every program file needed.
 -Run 'make all'
 -Open up a new terminal:
   -run './sender keyfile.txt' where "keyfile.txt" is the text file you are attempting to send.
 -Return to the first terminal where you ran the 'make all' command and run './recv'.
 -Your message should be sent.
 -Press and hold the CTRL + 'C' keys to clean the data.
 -Run 'make clean' when finished compiling program. 
  
– Whether you implemented the extra credit.

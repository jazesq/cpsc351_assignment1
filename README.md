We used C++.
To execute our program:
 -Open the terminal and ensure that the current directory contains every program file needed.
 -Run 'make all'
 -Open up a new terminal:
   -run './sender keyfile.txt' where "keyfile.txt" is the text file you are attempting to send.
 -Return to the first terminal where you ran the 'make all' command and run './recv'.
 -Your message should be sent.
 -Press and hold the CTRL + 'C' keys to clean the data.
 -Run 'make clean' when finished compiling program. 
  
– Whether you implemented the extra credit.
– Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.
  Our code only works on Ubuntu Version 17.10
CONTRIBUTIONS:
  
  Chris: I worked on mainly the sender.cpp file with Jonathan and later the recv.cpp for dealing with the output in the last half of our project's timeline. We were able to finish the sender.cpp file using online resources provided by the professor. I mainly implemented the if statements as well as other functions while Jonathan did the bulk of the research. 
  
  Jazmin: I worked with Melissa on the recv.cpp portion of the program. We divided the project by the 
  .cpp files. Melissa and I were able to finish most of the functions and had our other partner's help with the print function. We also contributed to the Makefile. 
  
  Melissa: We divided the project into two parts. Jazmin and I worked together to complete the recv.cpp file. We researched and found resources online regarding Interprocess Communication and used what we learned to implement it into our part of the project. We contributed in combining our part with our partners working on the sender.cpp file.
  
  Jonathan: I worked with Chris on the sender.cpp file. Using the online resources provided by the professor as well as other online resources, I was able to help Chris implement Shared Memory and Message Queues into the sender.cpp file.
